/*
Package tools provides command line tools that utilize the various repositories
in the github.com/TuftsBCB organization.

In most cases, command line tools are typically very small and only
representative of an interface to interact with an existing library. In more
exceptional circumstances where performance is needed, a command line tool
may use concurrency in an attempt to decrease execution time.
