This package provides simplified wrappers around computational biology tools
that are typically operated from the command line.

This package provides types and functions for common operations on protein
structures. Currently, the central contribution of this package is to
efficiently compute the RMSD between sets of points using a port of
Theobald and Liu's quarternion-based characteristic polynomial rotation
calculation method.
